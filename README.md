## Project Description

### Overview: 

We will be making a Discussion Forum Website called Pondr. It will draw inspiration from established forums like Reddit and HackerNews. Pondr aims to create a user-friendly environment that encourages free-flowing discussions and facilitates thoughtful and meaningful dialogue. Discussions will be implemented in a hierarchical structure (known in most forum applications as a thread) where registered users make posts, comment on their own or other’s posts, and reply to other comments.

### Goals:

Pondr is committed to providing a rich, interactive and unique environment for discussion. Its objectives include:

- Facilitating conversations on various subjects, ideas and topics.
- Creating a seamless sharing experience of stories, opinions and multimedia.
- Providing unrestricted viewing access to all visitors to ensure wider reach and more inclusive participation.
